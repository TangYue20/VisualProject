A group named the Protectors of Kronos (POK) was the prime suspect in the disappearance. Three mini-challenges and a grand challenge were offered. For more information, please see VAST Challenge 2021.\r\nThis module will research Mini-Challenge 3 which includes multiple types of text data for participants to feature real-time streaming social media and emergency service data for participants to provide hostage and kidnapper information.This challenge has 3 tasks and questions and asked the participants to integrate results to evaluate the changing levels of risk to the public and recommend actions. The visualization application is created by R shiny as the platform. The insights derived could provide useful information and guides how to identify important messages online, which would helpful for polices to tell useful information and discard unless information. Besides, the evaluation of risk would provide important guided for keeping public security.\r\n2. Obejctive\r\nThe application uses the free and open-source R language that offers a thriving programming environment for statistical and graphical analysis. Our 4 design considerations for development:\r\nPerforming calculations/logic within R for reproducibility,\r\nUsing standard R packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network(CRAN) for supportability.\r\nUsing Shiny to webify the codes for simplicity.\r\nProviding options and visualizations for interactivity.\r\n3.Data Source\r\nThree datasets in Mini-Challenge 3 are provided:\r\nMicroblog records that have been identified by automated filters as being potentially relevant to the ongoing incident.\r\nText transcripts of emergency dispatches by the Abila, Kronos local police and fire departments.\r\nmaps of Abila and background documents.\r\nThe data of Microblog and text transcripts of emergency dispatches are found in three segments:\r\nSegment 1 :“csv-1700-1830.csv” - covers the time period from 1700 to 1830 Abila time on January 23.\r\nSegment 2: \"csv-1831-2000.csv’- covers the time period from 1830 to 2000 Abila time on January 23.\r\nSegment 3: “csv-2001-2131.csv” - covers the time period from 2000 to shortly after 2130 Abila time on January 23.\r\nThe number of “Total Message”, “Message Blog” and “Call Center” is 4063, 3872 and 191.\r\n4.Data Preparation\r\nAll data preparations are performed using R. We combined the data of Microblog and text transcripts and convert the date variable to right time format, which is necessary for the following analysis. And based on content of data provided, we classified records into three segments: Junk, Typical_Chatter and Meaningful records.\r\nJunk: Referred to advertisements or financial purpose reports.\r\nMeaningful: Refers to informative records which spread real news about ongoing or impending events happen in Aliba.\r\nTypical Chatter: Represents no meaningful and irrelevant or inappropriate messages post online.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The framework and presentation for visual analytics are R Shiny application. The report illustrates the motivation behind and application, exploring how visual analytics can be leveraged to provide important hints for Kronos incident scenarios. The report covers the topic of text mining, text analytics and text visualization. Besides, a full step user guide is also provided for easy replication. Moreover, the report concludes the concerns and limitations of in this application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

On January 20th, 2014, a corporate meeting is held to celebrate the new-found fortune because of the initial public offering of the company. However, a series of rare events occur that lead to the disappearance of several employees. The Protectors of Kronos (POK), a social movement organization that has been fighting against water contamination and government corruption, is suspected in the disappearance.\r\nAs analysts, we were assigned with several tasks in order to identify risks and how they could have been mitigated more effectively.\r\nObjective\r\nUsing data and visual analytics to evaluate the changing levels of risk to the public and recommend actions for first responder:\r\nDistinguish meaningful event reports from typical chatter from junk or spam.\r\nEvaluate the level of the risk to the public evolves over the course of the evening. Consider the potential consequences of the situation and the number of people who could be affected.\r\nDetermine the appropriate location for first responders.\r\nThe differences between dealing with this challenge in 2014 and dealing with it now.\r\n2.0 Data Source\r\nThe data source is from Vast Challenge 2021.. The data has\r\nMicroblog records that have been identified by automated filters as being potentially relevant to the ongoing incident.\r\nText transcripts of emergency dispatches by the Abila, Kronos local police and fire departments.\r\nGeospatial data and map of Abila and Kronos Island.\r\nMa and background documents.\r\n3.0 The overall procedure.\r\nThe overall procedure is depicted in the picture.\r\n\r\nThe task one\r\nUsing basic feature of junk and meaningful records in microblog to conduct initial identification and classification.\r\nCompare the records of the police and fire department to classify false posts and valid event records, further improving features extraction.\r\nClassify meaningful record and junk.\r\nTwo methods would be used to present to identify significant record and junk:\r\nUsing word cloud present key words of meaningful post and junk post.\r\nUsing histogram or bar chart present the words features(like sentence length) of meaningful and junk post.\r\nThe task two\r\nMeaningful Record after validation would be used in task 2.\r\nLabel event with risk involved which ranking from level 1 to level 5 according to its influence and severity. And level 5 is the most serious.\r\nUsing regular expression to extract the number of people involved in events.\r\nThe distribution of event with multiple risks would be presented over the course of the evening.\r\nThe original thought of visualization is below:\r\n\r\nThe task three\r\nMeaningful Record after validation would be used in task 3.\r\nIntegrating geospatial data to present the location of events with various risks.\r\nClustering events based on variables ‘Time’, ‘Latitude’, ‘Longitude’ and risk level to show event distributions with some same features.\r\nThe original thought of visualization is below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
